# Face Recognition Attendance System

This is a **Face Recognition Attendance System** built using **Streamlit, OpenCV, Face Recognition API, Pandas, and SMTP Email Notifications**. The system allows users to mark attendance through facial recognition, generate QR codes for registration, track rewards based on attendance, and send email notifications to an admin.

## Features
- **Face Registration:** Capture and register new faces with QR code generation.
- **Face Recognition:** Identify and mark attendance for registered faces.
- **Attendance Tracking:** Store attendance records with timestamps.
- **Rewards System:** Assign badges (Gold, Silver, Bronze) based on attendance count.
- **Email Notifications:** Send attendance details with an image to the admin.
- **Attendance Reports:** Generate PDF reports for attendance logs.
- **Webcam Support:** Real-time face recognition via webcam.

## Requirements
### Install Dependencies
Ensure you have Python installed, then install the required libraries:
```sh
pip install streamlit opencv-python numpy face-recognition pandas requests qrcode reportlab pillow
```

## Usage
### 1. Run the Application
```sh
streamlit run app.py
```
### 2. Register a New Face
1. Click **Register New Face**.
2. Capture an image and enter your name.
3. The image will be stored, and a QR code will be generated.

### 3. Start Attendance System

## Configuration
Modify the following variables in `app.py` as needed:
- `SENDER_EMAIL`: Admin email for notifications.
- `SENDER_PASSWORD`: App password for SMTP authentication.
- `TRAINING_IMAGES_DIR`: Directory for storing registered images.
- `TOLERANCE`: Face recognition threshold (default: 0.6).
- `MODEL`: Face recognition model (`hog` for CPU, `cnn` for GPU).
- `QR_FOLDER`: Directory for storing QR codes.

## Notes
- **Email Notifications** require a Gmail App Password (not your regular password). Enable **Less Secure Apps** or use **App Passwords** in Gmail settings.
- **Face Recognition** works best in well-lit environments.
- **Reward System** assigns badges based on attendance count.
